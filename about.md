Stelpur Forrita started as a discussion by two students in computer science at the University of Iceland. Identifying the need for better preparation prior to the start of the university and the true importance of social support network in student resilience, Stelpur Forrita is designed as a workshop where participants have the chance to explore interesting topics in IT through hands-on projects led by experts in the field.

# What we aim to do

Stelpur Forrita is created with the following goals:
1. To increase interest and participation in Computer Science and Software Engineering among women and genderqueer individuals. Long-term goal: To improve gender balance within student cohorts in the Computer Science and Software Engineering departments at the university level.
2. To foster a sense of belonging for women and genderqueer individuals pursuing higher education in Computer Science and Software Engineering. Long-term goal: To improve gender balance in the graduating class.
3. To facilitate a mentor-mentee relationship between women and genderqueer individuals with established careers in IT and their student counterparts. Long-term goal: To establish a sense of solidarity and unity in ensuring diverse voices and interest are advocated for in the IT field.

# How we plan on achieving our goals

To approach the three goals above, we strive to create a fun and informative 5-day workshop as an early engagement program in which:
1. Participants have the opportunity to make meaningful social connections with peers who share their interest in IT.
2. Participants can connect with role models who provide insight to academic life and career paths/opportunities after graduation.
3. Participants can make the connection between theoretical knowledge taught at university with their real-life application, with the guidance of subject matter experts.
