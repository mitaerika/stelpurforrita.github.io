Steinunn is a PhD student in language technology at the University of Iceland. Her work focuses on detecting and mitigating prejudice in large language models trained in Icelandic. She finished her master's degree in the same field in 2020, partly from Gothenburg's university and partly from the University of Iceland. She holds BA degrees in Icelandic and French, also from the University of Iceland but partially from Concordia University. Her work experience comes from various fields, including the NLP team at the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, elementary school teaching, and project management at an interpreter's office. She particularly enjoys the multi-faceted nature of NLP and mixes elements of linguistics, computer science, and sociology in her research.
